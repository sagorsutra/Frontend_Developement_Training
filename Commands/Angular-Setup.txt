									###### SETUP ######

* CLI = Command Line Interface
* Angular CLI (ng) is required to create, build, test, and run Angular applications.
* Without CLI, you would need to manually configure:
  * Project structure
  * Webpack
  * TypeScript
  * Testing setup
  
* Angular has its official CLI: @angular/cli
* React does not have an official CLI. Instead, it uses multiple project starters:
  * CRA (npx)
  * Vite
  * Next.js

## CLI INSTALL ##

Command:
npm install -g @angular/cli [installs the latest]
npm install -g @angular/cli@14 [installs the version 14]

 *For a version 14 Angular project we have to install the 14 version of CLI. And It's same for the other version as well.*

Now, Every Angular version support distinct version of node and typescript. The required TypeScript get installed by default with the Angular project so, we don't have to worry
about that. We just have to make sure our computer is running on the correct node version for the specific Angular project.

For this we have to use a node version controler such as NVM, and swith the node version for different version of Angular.
For example,

## Our computer has node 22.18.0, this is compatible for Angular 20.
	So, if we run: 
		-> nvm current
			22.18.0
			
		Now, install Angular CLI. *Node 20 support the latest Angular version.* So;
		-> npm install -g @angular/cli
		
		This installs the Angular 20 CLI. we can check it by running;
		-> ng --version
			20.3.x
			
		Now, Create a Angular project;
		-> ng new <project-name>
		-> cd <project-name>
		-> ng serve
		
		The projects should open in the 4200 port.

## Now, to install a Angular-14 project. This is the tricky one. Because, our system is running on node-20 and Angular-14 is a very old version to be honest. To, do this first,
   we have to install a compatible node version, which is 16 in this case.
   
   First, we install the Angular-16 using NVM;
   -> nvm install 16
   -> nvm list
		*22.18.0 ( currently using )
		 16.20.2
		 
	Switch to node-16
	-> nvm use 16.20.0
	-> node --version
	
	Install the Angular-14 CLI;
	-> npm install -g @angular/cli@14
	-> ng version
		14.x.x
	
	Create Angular-14 project;
	-> ng new <project name>
	-> cd <project-name>
	
	Now, let's run the project
	-> ng serve
	
	Now, comes the confusion. we're very likely to see and error on the command line like this;
	[Symbol.dispose](): void;
	Cannot find name 'Disposable'
	Property 'dispose' does not exist
	on type 'SymbolConstructor'
	
	This happens because our Angular project uses typescript 4.7. but the @types/node@16.18.163 files are too new to compile using the TS-4.7 compiler. We need @type/node@16.11.x
	for this to work. So, we can do;
	-> npm uninstall @types/node
	-> npm install --save-dev @types/node@16.11.68
	
	This now, we have to delete and reinstall the dependencies to be safe.
	-> npx rimraf node_modules
	-> del package-lock.json
	-> npm install

	For install bootsrtap version 3
	-> npm install --save bootstrap@3
	Then Add this to angular.json file in Property
	-> "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
	
	Now, let's run the project again.
	-> ng serve
	
	Now the project should run at 4200 port.
	
**To find the compatible node and typescript version for a angular version visit the angular github repository and package.json**


									###### PROJECT STRUCTURE ######

tsconfig.json -> Hold all the settings, rules or configuration of the main TypeScript compiler.
tsconfig.app.json -> Holds current applicatoin's typescript configuration.
tsconfig.spec.json -> TypeScript configuration for the testing.
karma.conf.js -> Testing purpose
angular.json -> More about the CLI
main.ts -> main TS file.
environment -> There are two different environment file. One for developing or debug another for production.
polyfills.ts -> Browser information


*********************
Latest Tools, Multiple Angular Versions
1️⃣ Global Tools

Node: Keep latest (e.g., v22) via NVM

nvm install 22
nvm use 22
node -v


Angular CLI: Keep latest globally

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng version

2️⃣ Creating Angular Projects of Specific Versions

Angular 14:

npx @angular/cli@14 new my-angular14-app
cd my-angular14-app

(For version 14 installation we have to do this:
	-> npm uninstall @types/node
	-> npm install --save-dev @types/node@16.11.68
		
	This now, we have to delete and reinstall the dependencies to be safe.
	-> npx rimraf node_modules
	-> del package-lock.json
	-> npm install
)
ng serve


Angular 17:

npx @angular/cli@17 new my-angular17-app
cd my-angular17-app
npm install
ng serve


Latest Angular:

ng new my-latest-app
cd my-latest-app
npm install
ng serve


⚡ Key: Each project uses its own local CLI (node_modules/@angular/cli), so global CLI version doesn’t conflict.

3️⃣ Running Projects
cd project-folder
ng serve


Works for Angular 14, 17, or latest.

Node warnings may appear for older Angular versions but are usually safe to ignore.

4️⃣ Optional Node Switching

If an older project breaks, switch Node via NVM:

nvm install 16
nvm use 16
